**JavaScript is my programming language of choice.** In the past it definitely wasn't, but JavaScript has come a long way. 

The following is a short blog series about JavaScript. In part 1 I will dig a little into JavaScript's past, what will explain, why it wasn't considered to be a good programming language by many people in the past. Part 2 will show, that JavaScript has come a long way and is definitely a cool thing today for developers and companies. Finally in part 3, I will develop a view small mathematical problems in C, Java, Python and JavaScript and compare my personal developer experience during it.
