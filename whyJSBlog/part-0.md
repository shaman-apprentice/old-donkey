![JavaScript awkward penguin](./JavaScriptAwkwardPenguin.jpg)

This is a small trilogy about JavaScript. Part 1 gives context to the annoying past of JavaScript. Part 2 shows that JavaScript has come a long way since then. And in Part 3 I share my experiences with developing some mathematical problems in C, Java, Python and JavaScript.

After all **JavaScript is my programming language of choice** today.
