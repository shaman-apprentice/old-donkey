![JavaScript awkward penguin](./JavaScriptAwkwardPenguin.jpg)

When I talk with friends about programming languages, I often hear things like _"yuck, JavaScript - how can you really like it?"_. I wonder why so many people have negative feelings about JavaScript, because yeah, I really like it. So the following is some reasoning about JavaScript. It is split into the following three parts and in the end JavaScript is still my language of choice.

- Part 1: "Maybe not 100% optimal" past of JavaScript
- Part 2: Why JavaScript is definitely a cool thing
- Part 3: My personal language challenge _C_ vs _Java_ vs _Python_ vs _JavaScript_

## Part 1: "Maybe not 100% optimal" past of JavaScript

    - not == transitive
- Node.js (because JS was the worst language)
