# Part 2: Why JavaScript is definitely a cool thing

According to State of the Developer Nation survey<sup>[1](#References)</sup> JavaScript (including TypeScript) is the most popular programming language by far. This coincides with results from Stack Overflow's 2020 survey<sup>[2](#References)</sup> that
- JavaScript is the most used programming language and TypeScript is in the top 10.
- TypeScript is the second most loved programming language and JavaScript is in the top 10.
- Node.js is at the top of used miscellaneous frameworks, libraries and tools.

A further survey commissioned to an independent market research firm by Node.js<sup>[3](#References)</sup> concludes that Node.js has
- increased developer productivity by 68%.
- reduced development costs by 56%.
- increased application performance by 48% and uptime by 24%.

But lets dig a little deeper into the advantages of the JavaScript stack.

## As a professional developer I want to
- **develop as many features as possible**. Because implementing features means basically implementing business logic, what is the source of revenue for the client.
- **develop as fast as possible**. Because this means earlier revenue for the client and _time to market_ is a very important factor for success in highly competitive IT sector.

For both points no matter if frontend or backend JavaScript is a great choice.
    -> npm endless lib support
    -> stackoverflow most like language / many answers / good tutorials
    -> Easy to set up development / lightweight servers, no difficult cross-platform compiling whatsoever

## As Software Developer by hearth I want to
- **be productive** ("feedback loop")
    - I can decide level of "dirtiness": Prototype -> Typescript, real functional
- **have confidence in my Code**
    - Jest, Mocha, JS allows anything -> easy to mock imports, class members, whatever...

## Example 
... 2 + 2 - 1 = 3; quick math!
