# Why JavaScript is definitely a cool thing

1. As Professional:
  1.1 As many features as possible
    -? feature / business logic -> money
    -> npm endless lib support
    -> stackoverflow most like language / many answers / good tutorials
    -> Easy to set up development / lightweight servers, no difficult cross-platform compiling whatsoever
  1.2 As quick as possible
    -? earlier money
    -? time to market
      - vendor log in
      - earlier feedback
2. As Software Developer by hearth:
  2.1 Productive -> ("feedback loop")
    - 2 + 2 - 1 example webserver
    - I can decide level of "dirtiness": Prototype -> Typescript, real functional
  2.1 Unit tests
    - Jest, Mocha, JS allows anything -> easy to mock imports, class members, whatever...
