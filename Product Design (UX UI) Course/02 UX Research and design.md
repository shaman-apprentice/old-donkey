## General

> Trying to please everyone requires to dilute so much what makes your proposition unique that you’ll end up appealing to nobody.

> You don’t find customers for your products. You find products for your customers.

## Jobs to be Done Theory

> 1. People buy products and services to get a “job” done.
> 2. Jobs are functional, with emotional and social components.
> 3. A Job-to-be-Done is stable over time. [Getting from A to B]
> 4. A Job-to-be-Done is solution agnostic. [Not care if horse or car but fast and comfortable]
> 5. Success comes from making the “job”, rather than the product or the customer, the unit of analysis.
> 6. A deep understanding of the customer’s “job” makes marketing more effective and innovation far more > predictable.
> 7. People want products and services that will help them get a job done better and/or more cheaply
> 8. People seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform
> 9. Innovation becomes predictable when “needs” are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting the job done

## Lean UX

> Getting Out Of The Deliverables Business [(Jeff Gothelf)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/)

**Nimble design over heavy wireframes, comps or specs**

Concept -> Prototype -> Validate internally -> Test externally -> Learn from user behavior -> Iterate

Getting feedback is also aligning with team and stakeholder #TeamSpirit #ExpectationManagement and putting your work (partially) to a peace of reality, early #NoIvoryTower 

> Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic. (Jeff Gothelf)
