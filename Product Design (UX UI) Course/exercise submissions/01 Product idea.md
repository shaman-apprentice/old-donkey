## The problem / job to be done

When two people marry, they have to make a decision about their future family name.

In the past, it was common, that wife and husband take the husband's surname as common family name. Nowadays, at least in Germany, there are multiple possibilities:
- Wife and husband can each keep their family name.
- The wife can take the husband's family name or vice versa.
- They can adopt a combination of both family names as a common double name.
- One can keep his surname and the other can adopt a double name.

But how do they come to a decision? Is it too conservative to take the husband's name? Where do the surnames come from and what do they mean? What emotional significance do the surnames have for you and your families? 

## Product idea

A website that allows you to create a word cloud for each family name of the marrying parties. The marrying parties, their families and their friends can add words to the word cloud. A large language model like ChatGPT can add information about your family names and summarize the word clouds for you. The generated output can be used as a basis for a discussion about the future family name.

The goal is not exact science, but to provide a nice gadget. The overall user experience should be friendly and focusing on a fun generation of the word cloud.

## Competitive SWOT Analysis

There seems to be no direct competitors yet. The closest I could find were genealogy portals for family tree research.

| Product | Strength | Weaknesses | Opportunities | Threats
| - | - | - | - | - |
| [Forebears](https://forebears.io/)[^1] is a genealogy portal, which provides information for surnames. | It is easy accessible as webpage and ranked well in Google. It has a name distribution map and many random facts. | Layout is confusing and design is not very appealing. A lot of advertisement hides the real content. It is unclear why a user should register. | Add possibility to add user information and comments, so that it gets enriched by user content and users stay longer on the page and have a stronger user loyalty. | AI increasing in popularity as first research tool, decreasing page visits. |
| ChatGPT | You can ask any questions about your family names and ask follow up questions. | Danger of mixed up facts. | Specially train a model for family names and advice in choosing a name. | Future legal requirements for AI might restrict training data, making the models worse. |
| Own idea | Adds data to the emotional decision of family name choice. Joining the hype of AI. Direct customer contact as I am getting married soon and am "my own customer" for a MVP. | Creation of the webpage will be more or less an one man army project, meaning limited resources available. | Be the first on the market and provide a nice gadget for marrying parties. | A company specialized in weddings releasing a full scale product / solution. |
