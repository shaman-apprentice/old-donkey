- Design is Storytelling

> Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic. (Jeff Gothelf)

> Technology changes fast, people slow

> Perception is a dynamic process. Our senses are driven by action and seek pattern. Our picture of the world at any instant is shaped by what we want to do.

> Through good UX you are trying to reduce the friction between the task someone wants to accomplish and the tool that they are using to complete the task.

> Keep in mind that you may be critiquing someone else's hard work here, so be sure to soften any overly sharp or critical language

> When you work on a product day in and day out you can start to become too familiar with it, seeing and accepting all the pragmatic trade-offs that you have been struck to make a complex thing possible. That perspective can make you an apologist for a product's shortcomings.

**Define abstraction levels, and what you want to test. Prevent showing a coded example, and getting feedback about buttons not aligned, when you want to discuss a possible work flow!**

### UX parts
- Visual Design
- Content strategy
- BA
- Product Management
- Branding
- Information Architecture
- **User Research**

> the successful product has to appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what to purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects that are important during usage. The best products do not always succeed. To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.

### The DESIGN of EVERYDAY THINGS

- **Industrial design:** Optimize function for benefit of manufacturer and user.
- **Interaction design:** Enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. 
- **Experience design:** Focus on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.

Even experts make errors: So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.

- Design is about communication; *human <-> human & human <-> machine*
- Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined; We like, what we recognize fast. We recognize fast, what we have trained. We train, what we like...

### Product discoverability

- affordances \
               > feedforward
- signifiers  / (aka knowledge in the world)
- constraints
- mappings
- feedback - knowledge of results; is how expectations are resolved and is critical to learning and the development of skilled behavior.
- overall conceptual model: **Perceived** explanation how it works. Doesn't have to be "physical correct". E.g. files, folder and icons on screen - physical storage works different, but explanation is still very useful. OS developer need different conceptual model. Relations between goal, controls and outcome is important.

Good design must bring different skills, perspective and people together, which can even have competing gaols. Sells, support, manufactures, design, purchase, QA, developer, customer...

**Emotions and cognition are tightly intertwined** - Both can be caused or influenced by each other. Three levels of processing:

- Reflective
- Behavioral (conditioned / learned)
- Visceral

*Attractive things "work better"*, because they reflective evaluation is more forgiving for them.

### False blames

> If the wrong key was pressed, the last few minutes' of work was irrevocably lost. [...] I had made the error frequently and my analysis indicated that this was very likely to be a frequent error among users. The designer's first response was: "Why did you make that error? Didn't you read the manual?" He proceeded to explain the different functions of the two keys...

**Do not blame people when they fail to use your products properly. Take people's difficulties as signifiers of where the product can be improved!**

Instead of speaking of **human error** let's talk about communication and interaction between machine and operator, leading to "communication error" instead.

In the past, cost of displays etc. prevented many manufactures from providing useful feedback. Same goes for Software in terms of requirement analysis, developing and shipping. But tools have increased in quality and lowered in cost on both sides, hardware and software.

### Knowledge in the Head and in the World

Mapping / conceptual model depends on education and social conventions. E.g.:
- Time left to right, or right to left is coupled to reading direction
- Scroll: Moving the window (like in traditional PC) or the text (like in smartphones)? Should PC adjust to newly more prominent smartphones?

People only remember signifier needed for differentiating their task (e.g. detect real one cent coin between similar fake versions)

> The unaided mind is surprisingly limited. It is things that make us smart.

### Human Centered Design (HCD)

Improvement is a technical and social problem (admitting errors, so we can learn from them). It can be discouraged by laws or disrespect.

> A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all.

Where does the real problem comes from? Reality is complex with many factors; it needs iterative research.

> Effective design needs to satisfy a large number of constraints and concerns, including shape and form, cost and efficiency, reliability and effectiveness, understandability and usability, the pleasure of the appearance, the pride of ownership, and the joy of actual use. HCD is a procedure for addressing these requirements, but with an emphasis on two things: solving the right problem, and doing so in a way that meets human needs and capabilities.

 ### Standards

 Standards tame complexity. E.g. clock, which goes counterclockwise and has 9 at top.

 Standardize too early -> Bad, inefficient standard
 Standardize too late -> Everybody already uses something and adapting is too much effort, too expensive, ...

 ### As the world changes, what stays the same?

 > the principles of discoverability, of feedback, and of the power of affordances and signifiers, mapping, and conceptual models will always hold.
