- Design is Storytelling

> Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic. (Jeff Gothelf)

> Technology changes fast, people slow

> Perception is a dynamic process. Our senses are driven by action and seek pattern. Our picture of the world at any instant is shaped by what we want to do.

> Through good UX you are trying to reduce the friction between the task someone wants to accomplish and the tool that they are using to complete the task.

> Keep in mind that you may be critiquing someone else's hard work here, so be sure to soften any overly sharp or critical language

> When you work on a product day in and day out you can start to become too familiar with it, seeing and accepting all the pragmatic trade-offs that you have been struck to make a complex thing possible. That perspective can make you an apologist for a product's shortcomings.

**Define abstraction levels, and what you want to test. Prevent showing a coded example, and getting feedback about buttons not aligned, when you want to discuss a possible work flow!**
