- Design is Storytelling

> Nothing is more effective than walking over to a colleague, showing some work, discussing, sketching, exchanging ideas, understanding facial expressions and body language, and reaching a resolution on a thorny topic. (Jeff Gothelf)

> Technology changes fast, people slow

> Perception is a dynamic process. Our senses are driven by action and seek pattern. Our picture of the world at any instant is shaped by what we want to do.

> Through good UX you are trying to reduce the friction between the task someone wants to accomplish and the tool that they are using to complete the task.

> Keep in mind that you may be critiquing someone else's hard work here, so be sure to soften any overly sharp or critical language

> When you work on a product day in and day out you can start to become too familiar with it, seeing and accepting all the pragmatic trade-offs that you have been struck to make a complex thing possible. That perspective can make you an apologist for a product's shortcomings.

**Define abstraction levels, and what you want to test. Prevent showing a coded example, and getting feedback about buttons not aligned, when you want to discuss a possible work flow!**

> the successful product has to appeal to customers, and the criteria they use to determine what to purchase may have surprisingly little overlap with the aspects that are important during usage. The best products do not always succeed. To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.

### The DESIGN of EVERYDAY THINGS

- **Industrial design:** Optimize function for benefit of manufacturer and user.
- **Interaction design:** Enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occured. 
- **Experience design:** Focus on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.

Even experts make errors: So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.

- Design is about communication; *human <-> human & human <-> machine*
- Cognition and emotion are tightly intertwined; We like, what we recognize fast. We recognize fast, what we have trained. We train, what we like...

### Product discoverability

- affordances
- signifiers
- constraints
- mappings
- feedback
- overall conceptual model: Explanation how it works. Doesn't have to be "physical correct". E.g. files, folder and icons on screen - physical storage works different, but explanation is still very useful. OS developer need different conceptual model. Relations between goal, controls and outcome is important.

Good design must bring different skills, perspective and people together, which can even have competing gaols. Sells, support, manufactures, design, purchase, QA, developer, customer...
