Types of Work (amended)
Planned Work:
	- Business Projects
	- Internal Projects
Unplanned Work (kind of technical / organisational / understanding customer / ... debt) - paid down by:
	- more deployments -> shortens delta to debug and fastens feedback loop
	- encourage to use 15-30% of time for payback
	- improve operability and monitoring

Three way of DevOps:
1. System Thinking:
	- "Workstations" create value chains; probably only last item of chain generates cash out
	- Only Work at bottlenecks matters
	- Reduce handovers and dependencies
2. Many and short feedback loops
	- plan, Do, Check
	- improve time to market
3. Experiment and meassure
	- KPI's
